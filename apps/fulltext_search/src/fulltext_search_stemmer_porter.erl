% of their official duties. Pursuant to title 17 Section 105 of the
% United States Code this software is not subject to copyright
% protection and is in the public domain. This software is an
% experimental system. NIST assumes no responsibility whatsoever for

%
%
% The basic philosophy behind this implementation is to map the
% structure of Martin Porter's original description of his algorithm
% (http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer) as closely as possible
% into Erlang. I made liberal use of Erlang's pattern matching
% facility. In order for this to work, there is one quirk - the
% word to be matched must be reversed before it is stemmed: "hopping"
% becomes "gnippoh". This is necessary because Erlang's pattern
% matching won't work with Stem ++ "ing" but instead requires
% "gni" ++ Mets (where Mets is the backwards stem).  Despite this
% quirk, the flipping the words allowed me to greatly simplify the
% rest of the coding, almost to the point of being a tedious translation
% of the textual description of the algorithm.
%
% Thanks to Paul Black for his helpful comments.
